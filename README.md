# Comprehensive Reference Atlases for Embryonic Development

## Overview
This repository provides resources for studying human embryonic development from peri-implantation to gastrulation. This critical period is key to understanding cell lineage specification and tissue generation. With the growing use of stem-cell-based embryo models replicating this stage *in vitro*, this work addresses the pressing need for well-curated, integrated post-implantation cell references.

## Highlights
- **Comprehensive Reference Atlases**:
  - Constructed for both human and monkey embryos.
  - Enable systematic annotation of embryonic development.
- **Automated Cell Type Recognition**:
  - Human references are coupled with label transfer algorithms.
  - Supports cell type identification in both spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data.
- **Benchmarking Framework**:
  - Includes curated annotations for nine human embryo models.
  - Metrics to assess fidelity and lineage development synchrony in embryo models.

## Key Features
1. **Post-implantation Cell Reference**:
   - Provides a robust foundation for annotating embryonic development data.
2. **Label Transfer Algorithms**:
   - Facilitates automated cell type recognition.
3. **Benchmarking Metrics**:
   - Quantifies fidelity and lineage development in *in vitro* embryo models.

## Applications
- Characterization of embryonic models.
- Evaluation of lineage development synchrony.
- Automated annotation of transcriptomic datasets.

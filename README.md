## Introduction
This repository contains the codebase for a comprehensive study on the placenta, focusing on aspects such as cell-cell communication, differential gene expression, and pseudotime analyses among others. This project utilizes various bioinformatics tools and methods to analyze single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data for in-depth understanding of placental biology.
